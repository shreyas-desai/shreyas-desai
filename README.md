# Namaste !🙏</br> call me shreyas.

Welcome to my coding space! 🚀 I'm on a mission to explore the wonders of GANs and Transformers. Currently, I'm cruising through my Master's in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.



## About Me

- 🎓 **Education:** Master's in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology *(Sep '23 - May '25)*
- 🌍 **Location:** Exploring the world of tech from wherever the code takes me! (Formally speaking, USA :D)

## What I've Been Up To

### 🚀 Experience

#### Software Engineer @ Extrapreneurs India Pvt. Ltd *(Nov '21 - Jul '23)*
- Spent my days crafting FastAPIs, dancing with Java APIs, and orchestrating data ballets between PostgreSQL and Salesforce.
- Also, got cozy with Salesforce Bulk Data API and AWS S3 Bucket for some serious data moves.

#### Machine Learning/Data Engineering Intern @ SessionAI *(Aug '22 - Feb '23)*
- Unleashed the power of LSTM models to provide personalized recommendations.
- Played a pivotal role in crafting a transformer-based model, deciphering customer sentiment on deliveries within defined time frames, developed ML regression models and did a bit of statistical sorcery.

### 🛠️ Projects

#### Income Classify
- Used data magic to classify individuals into salary brackets and brought the spotlight on income disparity.
- Demystified the art of predicting income levels based on demographics.

#### PhishURL
- Built a fortress against phishing with a dataset showdown of benign and malign URLs.
- Trained machine learning models and summoned a user-friendly web app for instant phishing risk checks.

#### SentimentTracker
- Forged a sentiment analysis engine handling 10,000+ daily reviews and posts, discerning trends with 85% accuracy. Ranked sentiment volatility weekly for agile response to evolving customer sentiments.

#### Petals to the Metal (Kaggle)
- Played the Kaggle game, applying data augmentation spells and training models for image classification.

#### Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets (Kaggle)
- Went full wizard with distilBERT and achieved high f1-scores in the disaster tweets arena.
